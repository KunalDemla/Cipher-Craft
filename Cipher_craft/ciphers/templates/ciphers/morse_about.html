    About the Morse code
</h4>

<p class="card-text">
    Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.[3][4] Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.

    International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters a through z, one accented Latin letter (Ã©), the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters.[1] Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit. Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.[1] Until 1949, words were separated by a space equal to five dits.[5]

    The algorithm is very simple. Every character in the English language is substituted by a series of 'dots' and 'dashes' or sometimes just singular 'dot' or 'dash' and vice versa. <br>
    Every text string is converted into the series of dots and dashes. For this every character is converted into its Morse code and appended in encoded message. Here we have copied space as it is. We have considered both numbers and alphabets.
