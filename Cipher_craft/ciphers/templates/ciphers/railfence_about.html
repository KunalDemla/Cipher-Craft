    About the Railfence Cipher
</h4>

<p class="card-text">
    Given a plain-text message and a numeric key, cipher/de-cipher the given text using Rail Fence algorithm.
    The rail fence cipher (also called a zigzag cipher) is a form of transposition cipher. It derives its name from the
    way in which it is encoded. </p>

<p class="card-text">
    <strong>Encryption</strong><br>
    In a transposition cipher, the order of the alphabets is re-arranged to obtain the cipher-text.
<ul>
   <li>In the rail fence cipher, the plain-text is written downwards and diagonally on successive rails of an imaginary
    fence.</li> 

<li>When we reach the bottom rail, we traverse upwards moving diagonally, after reaching the top rail, the direction is
    changed again. Thus the alphabets of the message are written in a zig-zag manner.</li>    

    <li>Then, we fill the cipher-text row wise. After filling it, we traverse the matrix in zig-zag manner to obtain the original text.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p class="card-text">
    <strong>Decryption</strong><br>
    As we've seen earlier, the number of columns in rail fence cipher remains equal to the length of plain-text message. And the key corresponds to the number of rails.
    <ul>
    <li>    Hence, rail matrix can be constructed accordingly. Once weâ€™ve got the matrix we can figure-out the spots where texts should be placed (using the same way of moving diagonally up and down alternatively ).
    </li>
    <li> Then, we fill the cipher-text row wise. After filling it, we traverse the matrix in zig-zag manner to obtain the original text.
    </li>
    </ul>
